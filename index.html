I notice you've shared what appears to be a template or placeholder for an AI prompt, but it's not a complete or functional prompt itself. The content shows:

```
{{ $('Prepare AI Prompt').item.json.prompt }}
```

This looks like it might be from a system that uses templating syntax (possibly a note-taking app like Obsidian with a plugin) where `$('Prepare AI Prompt')` references some kind of data structure containing an AI prompt.

To help you better, I'd need:
1. The actual content or context around this template
2. What specific task or question you want the AI to help with
3. Any additional details about what type of response you're looking for

Could you provide more information about what you'd like me to assist with? For example, are you trying to:
- Generate a specific type of prompt?
- Understand how this template works?
- Get help crafting an AI prompt for a particular purpose?

I'm happy to help once I understand your specific needs!
